# Politics

My attempt to summarise the current state of my political opinions on the issues where I have any.

## Housing

The most important issue in politics is housing. We don't build enough, especially in places with well-paid jobs. This means people spend massive percentages of their income on rent. That means they can't spend as much on other things or save to buy a place of their own. It might be a decent system if you are a landlord who inherited a property or bought it years ago when it was cheaper. However, it's probably still bad for you because the growth of the economy is massively constrained by people not being able to move to places where they would be productive.

### Street Votes

Lots of my friends support a policy called "street votes". The idea is that homeowners along a street or block could vote to give themselves collective planning permission to redevelop their street. This might mean they all have permission to add two floors to their two-story houses, or that a developer can turn their detached houses into a terrace, a mansion block, or something else. The existing residents might then have one house that's twice as big, or a two-story flat on top of another flat that they can let out, or maybe nothing will have changed on their particular bit of the street except that they are now much richer because they have the planning permission to rebuilt or extend if they so wish. This way we could double the density of many suburban, but the existing residents wouldn't mind because they would still be wealthier.

### Green Belt Reform

British cities are surrounded by greenbelts which limits their ability to grow. But lots of the greenbelt is not very remarkable. Some of it is already covered by concrete. Lots of it is intensive agriculture/golf courses etc. You could fit 1 million homes on 3.7% of London's greenbelt. We should declassify the bits of the greenbelt less than 15 minutes walk from a train station.

For a sense of what could be done if golf clubs were allowed to sell up developers whilst preserving the trees, have a scroll through [these proposals](https://twitter.com/search?q=golf%20from%3A%40pushtheneedle&src=typed_query&f=image).

### Scrap Stamp Duty

Stamp duty stops old people from downsizing to somewhere they would find more manageable. That, in turn, means large houses that people with growing families would like to move into are unavailable. We should get rid of it.

### Right to sublet

### Stop pumping money into the housing market

In the absence of meaningful planning reform, the government has a habit of "helping people get onto the housing ladder" by giving them money to buy houses in the case of Help to Buy or selling them a council home for less than it is worth. This might be great for a small but politically influential group who take advantage of the scheme, but it drives up the price of houses for everyone else. Scrap them.

Housing Benefit is another very expensive form of welfare that should be replaced with direct cash transfers to the poorest people in society. Then they could choose whether they want to stay where they are or move to somewhere cheaper where their money would go further.

### Get rid of affordable housing requirements

Price controls are always bad. Affordable housing requirements are effectively a price control on a portion of a housing development.

In a market without price controls, supply goes up as the price up while demand falls. The point at which the two lines intersect is the equilibrium and determines the price of the good and the quantity of it that will be supplied.

When transactions of the good take place at this equilibrium price there will be consumers who would have still paid if the price was higher and producers who would have still supplied the good if the price was lower. You can see this in the figure. Regions $$A + D$$ represent the consumer surplus and regions $$B + C + E$$ represent the producer surplus.

Things get worse when we introduce price controls. At the lower price, $$Price_{ceiling}$$, the developer reduces the supply. The surplus represented by regions $$D$$ and $$E$$ disappears.

You might point out that the consumers more than make that up because of the region $$B$$ switching from being producer surplus to being consumer surplus. And it's true that if you do manage to buy the same good at an artificially low price you have done well. But notice the gap between supply and demand at $$Quantity_{ceiling}$$. We've now created a shortage. There will be a lucky few who are living comfortably in their cheap home. But for everyone else, it doesn't that that homes are nominally cheap because there aren't any for them to move into. This is why in places with rent control like Stockholm you get long queues of people waiting for a cheap apartment to become available. It would be much better if developers could just build as much as the market demands.

There can be negative externalities caused by developments and ideally, something like a [section 106 agreement](https://www.kslaw.co.uk/site/library/kslaw_legal_news/what-is-a-section-106) could be used to offset this damage. But it's worth noting that most of the taxable value will come from the general tax due from the developer, and in the long run from the incomes of the people who live in the development.

### Easier change of usages

People are always complaining about declining high streets. Sometimes people propose restricting or taxing online shopping in some form. I think that would be bad. Online shopping is good. That's why people do it. If you want to make high streets better it should be possible for more people to live and work along and close to them. The future of the high street is fewer shops and more places services and more socialising.

## Welfare

It's generally better to give people cash than some sort of benefit in kind. So I tend to think that we should move towards something resembling a Negative Income Tax. This means that if you earn below a certain some, the government tops you up by a percentage rather than taking a percentage of your money from you. Here is a plot I made of an example of this system. The actual numbers are just for illustration. In this example, we have decided that the lowest income anyone over the age of 18 should receive £15,000 a year. So if you earnt nothing, the government would give you £15,000. Furthermore, once you start earning the government keeps topping you up until you are on £25,000 a year. That's the point in this example where you neither receive nor pay any money. Any money earned above between £25,000 and £60,000 in this example is taxed at 40% and any money earned above £60,000 is taxed at 50%

## Taxation

Tax should raise enough money, not create bad incentives or distortions in people's behaviour, not discourage investment, and be simple to understand. Here are some reforms I would like to see.

### Merge income tax and national insurance

Merge national insurance and income tax and don't withdraw the personal allowance. NI hasn't been a proper insurance scheme for decades. It's just an extra tax paid by working people to fund services for people who don't. It would be much fairer and more transparent to merge it with income tax.

### Fix the mess created by the withdrawal of the personal allowance

The way that rates of income tax increase, combined with the withdrawal of the personal allowance leads to some wacky marginal tax rates. See the graphs [here](https://iea.org.uk/themencode-pdf-viewer-sc/?file=/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Briefing_Taxing%20Problem_web_0.pdf).

### Peg tax brackets to inflation

Tax brackets should also be pegged to inflation to stop people drifting into higher ones despite not actually getting richer.

### VAT

VAT is a great tax. It raises lots of money and doesn't distort people's incentives. It's much less regressive than people think it is and this regressiveness can be corrected by give people money via the welfare system. I discuss giving people money in more detail in that section.

Unfortunately, politicians put lots of things into lower VAT brackets. This is bad because it distorts behaviour. We should remove these lower ratings and have a flat 20% VAT on everything.

VAT is also better than similar sounding US sales taxes. The former creates a natural audit trail because businesses are incentivised to report their transactions so they are not overcharged. See [here](https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/michael-gove-s-plan-to-scrap-vat-is-a-big-mistake) for more details. US sales taxes lack this so can accumulate and bias the economy in favour of large companies.

### Full expensing

Tax systems should not discourage investment. This is why it is good when businesses can offset their investments against their tax bills. The UK tax system discourages some forms of investment more than others. It is easier to offset investments in offices for instance than it is for investments in heavy machinery or factories. The government should stop discriminating between different types of investment and let businesses do more it. The recent "super-deduction" goes some way towards this but is currently a temporary measure.

### Replace council tax with a land tax

Council tax bands haven't been updated for ages which means the amount people are paying is based on what their house was worth in the 90s, not what it is worth now. This is unfair on council tax payers. It also distorts where councils will approve new homes or invest in new infrastructure.

But the more serious problem with council tax is that it is a tax on the total value of the property instead of just the value of the land. So if you invest in making the property bigger, better, or more productive you get hit with a higher tax bill. A land tax would incentivise people to make the most of our limited supply of land because the more valuable the property relative to the land it sits on, the money more the owner will have after they have paid their tax.

## Environmentalism

### Carbon Tax

We should stop emitting greenhouse gases because they cause global warming. But we shouldn't go cold turkey tomorrow because that would destroy the economy. So how quickly should we go and in what order? Should we never improve an airport or tap any new fossil fuel resources we find? Perhaps. Or perhaps not. It's very tedious to see people arguing over individual schemes when a carbon tax, increasing year by year would reveal which schemes are worth their environmental cost and which are not. So let's have one.

A carbon tax could replace lots of taxes that create red tape and makes the world more confusing to navigate like vehicle excise duty and air passenger duty. It would be a great complement to road pricing which I discuss in more detail in the transport section.

## Transport

### Road Pricing

Currently, we run our road network like a club where you have to pay whether you use it or not (general taxation). Then if you want to use it you pay an entrance fee (in the form of vehicle excise duty) but once you are inside the drinks are free. Unsurprisingly, things get messy. Compare this to the rail network where you pay per journey (the government also subsidises you, but directionally this is true). In France, you are charged every time you use the motorway. In London, there is a boundary charge for driving into the centre of the city. We should move towards a comprehensive system of per-mile road pricing. This could be enforced by a network of cameras to read number plates, a GPS device in each car, or both. The price could fluctuate throughout the day in order to manage demand. Fuel duty approximates road pricing but isn't as good. It costs the same whether you are driving in a very congested area or deserted road. It is also going to disappear as electric cars take over.
