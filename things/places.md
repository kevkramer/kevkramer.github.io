### Coffee Shops

The ideal coffee shop for working should have the following:

- Rectangular tables with legs far enough apart that you can tuck you seat underneath them, otherwise you find yourself leaning forward which is uncomfortable.
- Very good WiFi that isn't a faff to log in to. Personal hotspotting makes this less essential now. But if you're going to provide WiFi you should make it good.

#### Waterstones, Gower Street

Loads of tables. Square but legs a bit narrow. Can get onto eduroam WiFi if you sit close to the street facing window. Lots of UCL students contributes to academic ambience.

#### The Gentlemen Baristas, Piccadilly

Tables and benches are a good height and shape. Lots of plugs behind the seats. Fast unsecured WiFi. Good food. Feels quite crowded at weekends though.
