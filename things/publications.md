# Publications

A list of blogs, newsletters, podcasts, and publications that I like

## General Interest

### [Astral Codex Ten](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/)/[Slate Star Codex](https://slatestarcodex.com/)

The best blog and former blog on the internet. Scott Alexander would be my guess for the contempory writer most likely to be cited in the next century.

### [Marginal Revolution](https://marginalrevolution.com/)

Tyler Cowen is an inforvore. He coined the term I think. He and Alex Tabarrok push new content every day along with a host of links. It is nominally a very good economics blog, but my favourite posts are those that discusss the arts and travel. Tyler also has a [podcast](https://conversationswithtyler.com/) where he interviews various people.

### [Nintil](https://nintil.com/)

José Luis Ricón Fernández de la Puente has written some very impressive stuff. This year he has mostly been summarising the state of aging reseach so perhaps it should be grouped under science. However, he also writes about lots of other things so I included it here.

### [Gwern](https://www.gwern.net/index)

Another blog that could be grouped under science but feels broader. Gwern Branwen writes about so much that your best bet is to just go to his homepage and browse around.

### [The Economist](https://www.economist.com)

"To err is human. To er... um... ah... is unacceptable"

### [Dominic Cummings Blog](https://dominiccummings.com/)

Oh yeah this gets a mention. It's actually full of interesting stuff and exposed me to all sorts of new ideas. That is why I have not listed it under Politics. Reading this in 2015, including Dom's long essay _Some Thoughts on Education and Political Priorities_, prompted me to learn to program, get into machine learning, and not chase the PPE dream. So I really have to thank Dom for my career.

### [The Diff](https://diff.substack.com)

Byrne Hobart's analysis of whatever takes interest. Generally has a finance focus.

### [Thoughts in Between](http://tib.matthewclifford.com/)

Matthew Clifford co-founded Entrepreneur First and writes a weekley newsletter. It covers tech, geopolitcs, and anything published that week which takes his interest. He also has a [podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/thoughts-in-between-exploring-how-technology-collides/id1547838601).

### [Bits About Money](https://bam.kalzumeus.com/archive/rss/)

Patrick Mackenzie explains how the financial system works

### [Ian Visits](https://www.ianvisits.co.uk/)

Ian Mansfield writes about London, its history, its events, and its infrastructure. A fanstasic resource.

### [Consumer Surplus](https://sambowman.substack.com/)

Utility maximising posts from Sam Bowman

### [Epistemink](https://www.epistem.ink/)

Interesting but hard to say what it's "about"

### [Baldwin](https://bensouthwood.substack.com/)

thoughts on urbanism and assorted other things

## History and the Arts

### [A Clerk of Oxford](https://aclerkofoxford.blogspot.com/)

Probably the blog I'm most likely to recommend if asked, Eleanor Parker writes about medieval literature. She often posts the original followed by a translation and brings it to life with her own writing.

### [History for Atheists](https://historyforatheists.com/)

Tim O'Neil is an atheist who got annoyed by other atheists making a hash of their history. However, you should read this, and his previous blog [Amarium Magnum](http://armariummagnus.blogspot.com/) for really good book reviews and essays about the fall of Rome and the medieval world.

### [The Analogue Antiquarian](https://analog-antiquarian.net/)

Every two weeks comes a new post in an ongoing series. First there was the history of ancient Egypt from the perspective of those who rediscovered it. Then came ancient Greece told through its myths and then its histories. Then the mystery of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. Most recent was a history of Alexandria.

### [Age of Invention](https://antonhowes.substack.com/)

Anton Howes's newsletter on the industrial revolution is a terrific read from someone at the cutting edge of the field.

### [London Review of Books](https://www.lrb.co.uk/)

The world's greatest back catalogue. I tend to skip the pieces that cover current events since they do not age well. But some contributors like Adam Tooze always get a read.

### [Antigone](https://antigonejournal.com/)

A very good new online publication focussing on the Classics.

### [The Rest is History](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-rest-is-history/id1537788786)

Tom Holland and Dominic Sandbrook discuss a historical topic, sometimes with guests, always very good.

### [The Way of the Dodo](https://wayofthedodo.substack.com/)

A young newsletter from the pseudonymous Twitter account [Ancient Earthling](https://twitter.com/Dust_Foot), topics have included investigations of Shakespeare's sonnets and portraiture, and the question of why certain objects and environments are beautiful.

### [Terra Nullius](https://neddonovan.substack.com/)

Ned Donovan shines a light into various historical and geographical curiosities

### [Sagas from the Sea](https://sagasfromthesea.blog/)

Occasional pieces about all things Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Icelandic

## Science

### [Quanta](https://www.quantamagazine.org/)

My favourite science magazine. Quanta covers advances in maths and science and hits the sweetspot between too shallow and too deep every time.

### [Shtetl Optimized](https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/)

Scott Aaronson writes about Quantum Computation, complexity theory and liberalism. The go to source if you want to be up to date with advances in the first two, many of which come from him and his students!

### [In the Pipeline](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/)

Derek Lowe writes about medical science and has been particularly good reading in a year when advances in medical science have been the most important story in the world.

### [Not Even Wrong](https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/)

Peter Woit writes about Physics. He's a strong critic of string theory and often posts friendly correctives to articles in Quanta.

### [Dorigo's Blog](https://www.science20.com/quantum_diaries_survivor)

Tomasso Dorigo writes about particle physics. He often posts good explainers of work carried out using data from CERN. Very useful for learning about what they do beyond e.g. proving the existence of the Higgs.

### [Information Processing](https://infoproc.blogspot.com/)

Steve Hsu is a remarkable person, with feet in the worlds of physics and genetics. His blog covers both of those and more.

### [Bio Eats World](https://future.a16z.com/bio-eats-world/)

A podcast from Andreessen Horowitz. They discuss new papers, companies working in the space, and other developments.

### [Razib Khan](https://www.razib.com/bio/wordpress/)

This is one that could go in several different sections, with several different links. Razib is a genetisist with an interest in history and social science. He writes a lot about how genetics have illuminated various areas or archeology, and much more. He has several blogs and podcasts and has also written for various other publications. He is also on Clubhouse, a lot.

### [Science Fictions](https://stuartritchie.substack.com/)

Analysis and critiques of science as it is currently practiced from Stuart Ritchie

### [Scientific Discovery](https://salonium.substack.com/)

Summaries of various topical things in science from Saloni Dattani

## Technology

### [Benedict Evans](https://www.ben-evans.com/)

Benedict Evans writes about the tech industry on his blog and in his weekly newsletter. I don't quite know how to phrase this, but he has a knack for distilling events into ideas that make the world seem clearer. He also has a [podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/another-podcast/id1535359773) with Toni Cowan Brown.

### [Bloomberg NEF](https://about.bnef.com/blog/)

Lots of good pieces on the state of various decarbonisation technologies with forecasts for their adoption.

### [Increment](https://increment.com/)

A publication from Stripe Press. Lots of stuff about managing software teams but my favourite posts are those about the history and development of various projects. We should have more histories like those.

### [Casey Handmer](https://caseyhandmer.wordpress.com/)

Lots of good stuff about energy, space, and procurement.

### [Deep into the Forest](https://deepforest.substack.com/)

This is a good newsletter that gives a quick overview of various hard technologies.

### [Construction Physics](https://constructionphysics.substack.com/)

A newsletter that covers different approaches to building more productively, whether that be regulatory or technological.

## Politics

### [Palladium Magazine](https://palladiummag.com/)

In the 20th century, the free world had to meet the challenge of communism. With new ideas like Keynesianism and social democracy, old fashioned liberalism was able to emerge triumphant. We now face a new form of totalitarianism in the CCP but the governments of Europe and America are complacent. Palladium explores ideas that we may need if liberalism is to make it through the 21st century.

### [The Scholar's Stage](https://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/)

Tanner Greer writes about lots of things and I could have placed him in the History and Arts section. However, I will place him in politics as his area of expertise is China and Taiwan.

### [Thomas Forth](https://www.tomforth.co.uk/)

Tom's writing about the British state is essential reading in my opinion. It has had a huge influence on how I see politics and what I think is necessary to make ourselves richer.

### [Works in Progress](https://worksinprogress.co/)

This is a new publication from the ASI crew. It's very good.

### [Chartbook](https://adamtooze.substack.com/)

Adam Tooze has a newsletter now. It covers whatever is interesting him at that moment which tends to mean macroeconomics and international political economy.

### [In the Sight of the Unwise](https://inthesightoftheunwise.substack.com/)

Analysis whether ecclesiastical or political is always insightful.

### [Mugwumpery](https://mugwump.substack.com/)

"Someone plausible"

### [Normielisation](https://normielisation.substack.com/)

Britains sharpest political pundit

### [Value Added](https://duncanweldon.substack.com/)

Good posts on the British economy from Duncan Weldon

### [Notes on Growth](https://samdumitriu.substack.com/)

Occasion posts on british policy from Sam Dumitriu

### [The Dominion](https://thedominion.substack.com/)

Most focused on Canadian politics which actually makes it very relevant to Britain

### [Ziggurat](https://ziggurat.substack.com/)

John Myers explores ways to improve the world despite (and ideally because of) the political incentives people face

### [Full Stack Economics](https://www.fullstackeconomics.com/)

Some of the best explanations of various ideas swirling around the econ internet sphere

### [The War on Prices](https://ryanbourne.substack.com/)

Ryan Bourne writes sensible stuff about politics and economics
