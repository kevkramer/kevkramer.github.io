# My Setup

I think it's a good idea to write about how I would hypothetically recreate my configurations for various things. I don't have anything particularly exciting to share. However, even fairly typical configurations are built up over many hours so it's probably worth documenting.

### Terminal

We begin on any machine with a terminal. I have never used a Windows machine for programming, or a desktop version of Linux. On MacOS I would go and download <a href="https://iterm2.com/">iTerm2</a>. I don't actually know, even after several years of using it, what it does that the normal Mac terminal doesn't. It has a prettier icon though which was why I got it.

Inside the terminal for my shell I use <a href="https://ohmyz.sh/">ZSH and Oh My ZSH</a>. It has nice autocompletion and the tab button is useful.

### Text Editors

I use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a> for anything substantial and <a href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> or the iPython kernel for anything that will only take a few seconds. You can see my settings.json and .vimrc files [here](https://github.com/HenryDashwood/dot-files).

### Data Science and ML

I do all this in Python. Installing Python is actually quite painful. MacOS ships with Python 2.7 which is no longer supported by anything. Managing dependencies is also quite hard of don't work with a single version of Python. The solution is [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv). I use [this script](https://github.com/HenryDashwood/dot-files/blob/master/setup_python.sh) to install it and to setup my virtual environment. Once you start using this all the [jokes](https://xkcd.com/1987/) about how Python is hard to install won't hit so close to home.

There is some debate about the [cons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jiPeIFXb6U&t=1s) and [pros](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk) of using notebooks for data science. My synthesis of these two approaches is to use them when hacking my way to something but then to refactor them away as soon as I can. I have become more fond of them since VSCode started supporting them natively. It feels like less of a binary choice between different approaches to coding.

Perhaps my favourite feature of VSCode is its support for remote development. And my favourite place for remote development is [DataCrunch](https://datacrunch.io/). This place has everything. Cheaper GPUs than anywhere else I know, spin up a remote machine in seconds, hibernate it when you aren't using it. It's better than Sagemaker for literally everything when you are training models. I have no idea how they pull it off at the price they do.

For deploying models, I love [BentoML](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML). You can create a local endpoint with OpenAPI docs, get an [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) url, and deploy to any of the major cloud providers.

### Web Development

I'm planning to do a blog post and maybe a video on how I built this website since I didn't find any examples of anyone using this particular stack when I was creating it. It's a static site generated by [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/) and deployed to Amazon Lightsail using a custom Docker Image in Circle CI. Its optimised to teach me as much stuff as possible rather than to actually be a sensisble choice. Hakyll does have built in Pandoc support though so I'm looking forward to writing some notation heavy posts.

At work, every frontend prototype I have built [React](https://reactjs.org/) based.
